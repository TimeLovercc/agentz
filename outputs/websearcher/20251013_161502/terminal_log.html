          <pre>**Iteration 1 Observations:**

1.  **Query Comprehension:** The core task is understood: develop a web search workflow to identify and extract specific details (title, author, keywords, abstract, URL, formatted into a single sentence) for "outstanding papers" from ACL 2025.
2.  **Critical Temporal Mismatch:** The most significant immediate challenge is that ACL 2025 has not yet occurred. Papers for this conference, and especially designations like "outstanding," are not yet published or determined, making a direct search impossible at present.
3.  **Defining "Outstanding":** Beyond the temporal issue, the criteria for "outstanding" papers need definition. This will likely involve identifying official award winners (e.g., Best Paper, Distinguished Paper) which are only announced *during or after* the conference.
4.  **Strategic Workflow Adaptation Required:** Due to the temporal mismatch, the proposed workflow must include a strategy to handle the future-dated nature of the query. This could involve:
    *   Designing a *predictive/monitoring* workflow for ACL 2025, which outlines steps to be taken closer to the event (e.g., after proceedings are published, awards announced).
    *   Demonstrating the *methodology* using a past ACL conference (e.g., ACL 2024 or 2023) to illustrate the steps for finding "outstanding papers" and extracting information, then outlining how to adapt this for 2025.
5.  **Extraction & Formatting Consideration:** The workflow needs to explicitly address methods for extracting structured data (title, authors, etc.) from web sources and then programmatically or manually consolidating this information into a single sentence as per the requirement.</pre>

**1. Progress and Key Learnings:**
*   **Technical Blocker Identified:** The primary finding from Iteration 1 is a critical technical impediment: the `web_searcher_agent` implementation was not found. This means the intended method for web searching is currently unavailable.
*   **No Research Progress:** Due to this blocker, no actual web search has been performed, and thus, no information regarding ACL 2025 papers has been gathered.

**2. Emerging Patterns & Unclear Areas:**
*   **Tooling Dependency:** The research workflow is immediately dependent on the availability and functionality of specific tools (e.g., `web_searcher_agent`).
*   **Tool Availability:** It's unclear if the `web_searcher_agent` is genuinely unimplemented, misnamed, or simply inaccessible in the current environment. We need to confirm what web search capabilities *are* available.

**3. Strategic Recommendations for Next Steps:**
*   **Prioritize Tooling Resolution:** The immediate next step is to address the missing `web_searcher_agent`. The research cannot proceed until a functional web search mechanism is established.
*   **Verify Web Search Capability:**
    *   **Action 1 (High Priority):** Attempt to identify and utilize *any* existing web search tool or function within the current environment.
    *   **Action 2 (If Action 1 Fails):** If no direct equivalent is found, investigate how to implement or integrate a generic web search capability.
*   **Workflow Adjustment:** Until a `web_searcher_agent` or equivalent is available, the comprehensive web search workflow cannot be executed as originally conceived. Focus must shift to enabling this core functionality.</pre>

1.  **System Capability Blocked:** The most critical observation is that the research process is entirely blocked due to missing agent implementations (`web_searcher_agent` and `research_agent`). No actual progress on the user's query can be made until these foundational tools are available.

2.  **Temporal Constraint:** The query specifies "ACL 2025," which is in the future. Even if the `web_searcher_agent` were functional, it would not be able to find "outstanding papers" for a conference that has not yet occurred. This aspect of the query needs to be explicitly addressed.

3.  **Emerging Pattern: Tooling First:** The pattern from Iteration 1 and 2 clearly indicates a need to prioritize fixing the underlying system/tooling before attempting any content-related research.

4.  **Strategic Next Steps:**
    *   **Immediate Action:** The primary focus for Iteration 3 must be on resolving the `No implementation found` errors for `web_searcher_agent` and `research_agent`. This is a prerequisite for any further progress.
    *   **Acknowledge Temporal Issue:** Once tooling is addressed, the research plan needs to incorporate a strategy for dealing with the ACL 2025 date. This could involve:
        *   Clarifying the desired year with the user (e.g., did they mean 2024 or 2023?).
        *   If 2025 is firm, proposing a workflow to monitor for future publications, "call for papers," or related preliminary information, rather than current outstanding papers.
        *   Focusing on providing the *workflow design* for future search, even if live data isn't available yet.</pre>

Key findings reveal [[Summarize 2-3 most critical findings from [[FINDINGS]]]]. Specifically, we observed [[e.g., a strong correlation between X and Y, or that Model A outperformed Model B]]. Based on these insights, we recommend [[Summarize 1-2 key recommendations from the 'Recommendations' section]]. These recommendations aim to [[state the practical implication of recommendations, e.g., optimize resource allocation, improve decision-making, or mitigate risks]].

---

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Task and Objective

The primary objective of this project was to address the following query: **[[USER_PROMPT]]**.

Specifically, this involved:
*   [[Break down the USER_PROMPT into 2-3 specific analytical goals, e.g., "Identifying the most significant factors influencing [target variable]."]]
*   [[e.g., "Quantifying the impact of [specific feature] on [outcome]."]]
*   [[e.g., "Providing actionable insights and recommendations based on the analytical findings."]]

#### 1.2 Dataset Overview

The analysis was conducted using the dataset located at: **[[DATA_PATH]]**.
This dataset [[Describe the general nature of the dataset based on USER_PROMPT, e.g., "contains [number] records of [type of entity, e.g., customer interactions, sales transactions, sensor readings] across [number] features."]]. Key features within the dataset are expected to include [[mention 2-3 types of features, e.g., 'demographic information, behavioral metrics, and outcome variables']].

---

### 2. Methodology and Approach

Our approach to addressing the stated objectives involved a systematic data science pipeline, tailored to the specific nature of the [[DATA_PATH]] dataset and the query [[USER_PROMPT]].

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    *   The dataset was loaded from `[[DATA_PATH]]`.
    *   Initial steps involved [[mention general preprocessing steps, e.g., handling missing values (imputation or removal), outlier detection, and data type conversions to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis]].
    *   Feature engineering may have been performed to create new variables or transform existing ones for better model interpretability or performance.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Comprehensive EDA was conducted to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, relationships between variables, and potential anomalies.
    *   This included [[mention specific EDA techniques, e.g., 'univariate analysis (histograms, box plots), bivariate analysis (scatter plots, correlation matrices), and multivariate analysis to identify complex interactions.']].

3.  **Model Development and Evaluation (If applicable based on findings):**
    *   Depending on the `[[USER_PROMPT]]` and `[[FINDINGS]]`, this phase might have involved [[mention model types, e.g., 'building predictive models (e.g., regression, classification), clustering algorithms, or association rule mining.']]
    *   Models were trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their performance and generalization capabilities.

4.  **Insight Generation:**
    *   The core of the methodology involved extracting meaningful insights from the processed data and model outputs. This included [[mention techniques, e.g., 'interpreting model coefficients, analyzing feature importance, segmenting data, and identifying statistical significances.']]

5.  **Reporting and Recommendations:**
    *   The final stage involved synthesizing all findings into a structured report, highlighting key insights, and providing actionable recommendations.
