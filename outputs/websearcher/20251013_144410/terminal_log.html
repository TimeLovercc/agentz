          <pre>As a research observation agent, I am ready to analyze the state of your research and provide insightful observations to guide the process.

**Current Status:**
No research context (original query, iteration details, background, or previous findings) has been provided yet.

**Next Step:**
Please provide the necessary context, including:
*   The original query or task you are working on.
*   The current iteration number and any time elapsed.
*   Relevant background information.
*   Details of previous iterations, actions taken, findings, and any thoughts or challenges encountered.

Once this information is available, I will be able to reflect on progress, identify patterns, pinpoint areas for deeper investigation, and offer strategic recommendations for the next steps in your research.</pre>

          <h3>Observe_agent</h3>
          <pre>As a research observation agent, I am ready to analyze the provided context and offer insightful observations.

**Current Status:**
No research context (original query, iterations, findings, etc.) has been provided for analysis.

**My Approach (Once Context is Available):**
Upon receiving the research context, I will meticulously review:
*   **The Original Query/Task:** To understand the core objective.
*   **Current Iteration Number and Time Elapsed:** To gauge the project's stage and pace.
*   **Background Context:** To grasp the foundational information.
*   **Previous Iterations, Actions, Findings, and Thoughts:** To track progress, identify roadblocks, and understand the evolution of insights.

**My Observations will focus on:**
1.  **Learnings:** Summarizing key findings and confirmed hypotheses from past iterations.
2.  **Emerging Patterns:** Identifying recurring themes, correlations, or anomalies in the data/findings.
3.  **Unclear Areas:** Pinpointing what critical questions remain unanswered or require further clarification.
4.  **Strategic Next Steps:** Proposing actionable recommendations for future iterations to deepen understanding or address gaps.

**Please provide the research context so I can begin the analysis and offer specific observations.**</pre>

          <pre>It appears there was an issue with a preceding research agent, as indicated by the message "No implementation found for agent research_agent". This suggests that the research or data gathering phase did not complete successfully or did not provide any output for me to process.

As a technical writing agent, my function is to synthesize findings, create structured reports, and present insights *based on provided research data*.

To generate the comprehensive data science report you need, please provide me with the following:

1.  **The objective or task** of the data science research.
2.  **The methodology and approach** used (or intended to be used).
3.  **The key findings, data, or insights** that were uncovered.
4.  **Any specific data, metrics, or analysis results** you want to be included.
5.  **Desired recommendations** or implications.

Once you provide the research details, I can proceed with creating a well-structured and insightful report following the specified guidelines.</pre>
