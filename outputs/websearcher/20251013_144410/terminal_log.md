### Observe_agent

```
As a research observation agent, I am ready to analyze the state of your research and provide insightful observations to guide the process.

**Current Status:**
No research context (original query, iteration details, background, or previous findings) has been provided yet.

**Next Step:**
Please provide the necessary context, including:
*   The original query or task you are working on.
*   The current iteration number and any time elapsed.
*   Relevant background information.
*   Details of previous iterations, actions taken, findings, and any thoughts or challenges encountered.

Once this information is available, I will be able to reflect on progress, identify patterns, pinpoint areas for deeper investigation, and offer strategic recommendations for the next steps in your research.
```

### Evaluate_agent

```
{
  "research_complete": false,
  "outstanding_gaps": [
    "Original research query or task",
    "Current iteration number and time elapsed",
    "Relevant background information",
    "Details of previous iterations, actions taken, findings, thoughts, and challenges"
  ],
  "reasoning": "The research cannot be evaluated as complete or incomplete because no research context (original query, iteration details, background, or previous findings) has been provided. Without this information, it's impossible to assess progress, identify patterns, or determine next steps."
}
```

### Routing_agent

```
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "agent": "research_agent",
      "query": "Outline the essential components and best practices for defining a comprehensive research project brief. This should include details on how to capture the original research query, relevant background information, current iteration details, and a summary of previous iterations, actions taken, findings, thoughts, and challenges. This information is critical to establish a baseline understanding for any subsequent research or analysis tasks.",
      "gap": "Missing fundamental context for the research project, including the original query, background information, and historical project details, preventing any meaningful progress or evaluation.",
      "entity_website": null
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The current state explicitly identifies a critical knowledge gap: the complete absence of foundational research context, such as the original query, background information, and details of previous iterations. Without this information, it is impossible to understand the problem, evaluate progress, or plan next steps. The 'research_agent' is best suited to address this by outlining what constitutes a complete research brief, which will implicitly guide the next steps for gathering this crucial project context."
}
```

## Iteration 2
*Time:* 2025-10-13T18:44:39Z → 2025-10-13T18:45:08Z

### Agent Steps
- **observe_agent** · observe_agent (4.182s) · success
- **evaluate_agent** · evaluate_agent (2.828s) · success
- **routing_agent** · routing_agent (21.753s) · success

### Observe_agent

```
As a research observation agent, I am ready to analyze the provided context and offer insightful observations.

**Current Status:**
No research context (original query, iterations, findings, etc.) has been provided for analysis.

**My Approach (Once Context is Available):**
Upon receiving the research context, I will meticulously review:
*   **The Original Query/Task:** To understand the core objective.
*   **Current Iteration Number and Time Elapsed:** To gauge the project's stage and pace.
*   **Background Context:** To grasp the foundational information.
*   **Previous Iterations, Actions, Findings, and Thoughts:** To track progress, identify roadblocks, and understand the evolution of insights.

**My Observations will focus on:**
1.  **Learnings:** Summarizing key findings and confirmed hypotheses from past iterations.
2.  **Emerging Patterns:** Identifying recurring themes, correlations, or anomalies in the data/findings.
3.  **Unclear Areas:** Pinpointing what critical questions remain unanswered or require further clarification.
4.  **Strategic Next Steps:** Proposing actionable recommendations for future iterations to deepen understanding or address gaps.

**Please provide the research context so I can begin the analysis and offer specific observations.**
```

### Evaluate_agent

```
{
  "research_complete": false,
  "outstanding_gaps": [
    "The original research query or task",
    "Details of current and previous research iterations",
    "Specific findings or thoughts from any research conducted so far",
    "Background context relevant to the research objective"
  ],
  "reasoning": "No research context, original query, iterations, findings, or any other information has been provided. Therefore, it is impossible to assess any research progress or determine if any goals have been met."
}
```

### Routing_agent

```
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "agent": "research_agent",
      "query": "Please provide the original research query or task that needs to be addressed. This is essential to initiate any research or task routing.",
      "gap": "The original research query or task",
      "entity_website": null
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The user has not provided the original research query or task, which is the most critical knowledge gap identified. To proceed with analyzing any research progress or routing subsequent tasks, the primary objective must be explicitly defined. The 'research_agent' is selected to address this foundational gap by requesting the initial query, as understanding the research objective is fundamental to its role."
}
```

## Iteration 3
*Time:* 2025-10-13T18:45:08Z → 2025-10-13T18:45:36Z

### Agent Steps
- **observe_agent** · observe_agent (1.796s) · success
- **evaluate_agent** · evaluate_agent (2.221s) · success
- **routing_agent** · routing_agent (24.264s) · success
- **writer_agent** · writer_agent (4.46s) · success

### Observe_agent

```
Understood. I am ready to act as the research observation agent.

Please provide the context, including:
- The original query/task
- Current iteration number and time elapsed
- Background context
- Previous iterations, actions, findings, and thoughts

Once I have this information, I will provide concise, insightful, and actionable observations focusing on:
- What we've learned so far
- What patterns are emerging
- What areas need deeper investigation
- Strategic recommendations for next steps
```

### Evaluate_agent

```
{
  "research_complete": false,
  "outstanding_gaps": [
    "Original query/task not provided",
    "No research has been initiated"
  ],
  "reasoning": "No original query or task has been provided to begin research. As a result, no research has been conducted, and there are no findings, patterns, or areas of investigation to report. The first step is to define the research objective."
}
```

### Routing_agent

```
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "agent": "research_agent",
      "query": "Clearly define the initial research objective or core problem statement that needs to be addressed. This information is crucial to proceed with any data loading, analysis, or model training tasks.",
      "gap": "Original query/task not provided",
      "entity_website": null
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The primary knowledge gap is the absence of an original query or research objective. No specific tasks can be effectively routed to specialized agents without a clear problem statement. Therefore, the immediate next step is to establish this objective. The research_agent is best suited to initiate the process of defining the problem space and research goals, even if the actual objective needs to be provided externally."
}
```

### Writer_agent

```
It appears there was an issue with a preceding research agent, as indicated by the message "No implementation found for agent research_agent". This suggests that the research or data gathering phase did not complete successfully or did not provide any output for me to process.

As a technical writing agent, my function is to synthesize findings, create structured reports, and present insights *based on provided research data*.

To generate the comprehensive data science report you need, please provide me with the following:

1.  **The objective or task** of the data science research.
2.  **The methodology and approach** used (or intended to be used).
3.  **The key findings, data, or insights** that were uncovered.
4.  **Any specific data, metrics, or analysis results** you want to be included.
5.  **Desired recommendations** or implications.

Once you provide the research details, I can proceed with creating a well-structured and insightful report following the specified guidelines.
