          <h3>Observe_agent</h3>
          <pre>As a research observation agent, I am ready to analyze the state of your research.

Currently, no research context has been provided. To generate insightful observations and guide your research process, please provide the following information:

*   **The original query/task:** What was the initial problem or question you set out to investigate?
*   **Current iteration number and time elapsed:** Where are you in the research cycle?
*   **Background context:** Any relevant foundational information or prior understanding.
*   **Previous iterations, actions, findings, and thoughts:** A detailed log of what has been done, what was discovered, and any interim reflections or hypotheses.

Once this context is available, I can help reflect on progress, identify patterns, pinpoint areas for deeper investigation, and recommend strategic next steps.</pre>

The 'research_agent' is selected because it is ultimately responsible for orchestrating and conducting the research process and thus requires this crucial context to function and for any subsequent evaluation by other agents to be possible. The task is to solicit this missing information to enable further progress."

          <pre>No research context or previous iterations have been provided.

To offer insightful observations, I require the following context:

*   **Key Learnings:** Highlighting confirmed insights or debunked assumptions.
*   **Emerging Patterns:** Identifying recurring themes or unexpected correlations from previous data/findings.
*   **Uncertainties & Gaps:** Pinpointing areas where understanding is still limited or data is missing.
*   **Strategic Recommendations:** Suggesting specific actions or shifts in focus for the next iteration to address gaps and build upon learnings.</pre>

However, the 'research_agent' can address the knowledge gap by researching and defining what these contextual elements *should entail* according to best practices. This will help clarify the nature of the missing information, enabling the user to provide it more effectively. The 'Current iteration number and time elapsed' gap is a factual state that cannot be addressed by an agent in this manner and requires direct input."

          <pre>It appears that the `research_agent` did not provide any output or findings.

As a technical writing agent specializing in comprehensive data science reports, I require the synthesized findings, data, or output from your research agent (or any other source of research results) to generate the report.

Please provide the content, findings, methodology, or any relevant information from the `research_agent` so I can proceed with creating a well-structured data science report, including:

*   **Task/Objective Summary**
*   **Methodology and Approach**
*   **Key Findings and Insights**
*   **Actionable Recommendations**
*   **Proper Markdown Formatting**
*   **Code Examples (if relevant to the findings)**

Once you provide the research output, I will be ready to synthesize it into a professional and comprehensive report.</pre>
