### Observe_agent

```
**Iteration 1 Observations (Initial State)**

1.  **Temporal Constraint:** The core request for "ACL 2025 outstanding papers" presents a significant temporal challenge. ACL 2025 has not yet occurred, meaning no papers, let alone "outstanding" ones, are currently available. The initial focus must shift to anticipating *when* and *how* this information will become available.
2.  **Definition of "Outstanding":** The term "outstanding" is subjective and typically determined post-conference (e.g., best paper awards, nominations, high citation count after publication). The workflow needs to include a strategy for identifying this once content is available.
3.  **Workflow First:** Given the temporal constraint, the initial research step should be to design the *web search workflow* itself, anticipating the availability of information. This workflow should outline the steps to take once ACL 2025 papers and awards are published.
4.  **Strategic Recommendation:** Begin by researching ACL's typical publication timeline, best paper award processes, and official venues (e.g., ACL Anthology, conference website) for past conferences. This will inform a robust workflow for when 2025 data becomes available. We should also consider how to monitor for announcements related to ACL 2025.

### Evaluate_agent

```
{
  "research_complete": false,
  "outstanding_gaps": [
    "ACL 2025 has not yet occurred, so there are no papers, outstanding or otherwise, available to be extracted. The conference is scheduled for June 1-6, 2025."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The core request is to find papers from ACL 2025. As of the current date, ACL 2025 is a future event. Therefore, no papers, let alone 'outstanding' ones, have been published or announced for this specific conference. The task cannot be completed until after the conference has taken place and proceedings are made available."
