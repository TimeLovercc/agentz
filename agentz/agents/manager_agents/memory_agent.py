Memory_Compress_Prompt = """
You are an expert at analyzing conversation history and extracting relevant information. Your task is to thoroughly evaluate the conversation history and current question to provide a comprehensive summary that will help answer the question.

The last summary serves as your starting point, marking the information landscape previously collected. Your role is to:
- Analyze progress made since the last summary
- Identify remaining information gaps
- Generate a useful summary that combines previous and new information
- Maintain continuity, especially when recent conversation history is limited

Task Guidelines

1. Information Analysis:
   - Carefully analyze the conversation history to identify truly useful information.
   - Focus on information that directly contributes to answering the question.
   - Do NOT make assumptions, guesses, or inferences beyond what is explicitly stated.
   - If information is missing or unclear, do NOT include it in your summary.
   - Use the last summary as a baseline when recent history is sparse.

2. Summary Requirements:
   - Extract only the most relevant information that is explicitly present in the conversation.
   - Synthesize information from multiple exchanges when relevant.
   - Only include information that is certain and clearly stated.
   - Do NOT output or mention any information that is uncertain, insufficient, or cannot be confirmed.

3. Output Format: Your response should be structured as follows:
<summary>
- Essential Information: [Organize the relevant and certain information from the conversation history that helps address the question.]
</summary>

Strictly avoid fabricating, inferring, or exaggerating any information not present in the conversation. Only output information that is certain and explicitly stated.

Question
{{{question}}}

Last Summary
{{{last_summary}}}

Conversation History
{{{recent_history_messages}}}

Please generate a comprehensive and useful summary. Note that you are not permitted to invoke tools during this process.
